This runs through the code for the linear regression lessons from Real Python.

Notes:
  - used scikit learn for the fundamental fitting of regression objects. 
  - linearRegression.fit(x, y) is the common pattern
  - statmods is a lot more like R's summary readout for regression. It has the opposite order for predectors in the funtion. 
  - Used the venv package to build the virtual environment
    - source venv/bin/activate
    - deactivate
    - install packages: python -m pip install numpy scikit-learn statsmodels
  - Note: In scikit-learn, by convention, a trailing underscore indicates that an attribute is estimated. In this example, .intercept_ and .coef_ are estimated values.
  - Read thru the value of f strings as well. https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/
